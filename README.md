# Writing an Interpreter in Go

This project is based on the [book](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.

## What is being built?

An interpreter for a scripting language _Monkey_ that is inspired by ECMAScript.

## Why?

- I like ECMAScript (a.k.a. JavaScript), and I want to better understand how it works. 

- Go is popular, and I want to get more experience with it.
